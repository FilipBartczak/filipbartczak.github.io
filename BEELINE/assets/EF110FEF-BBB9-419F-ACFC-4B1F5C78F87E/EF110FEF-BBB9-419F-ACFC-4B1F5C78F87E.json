Sometimes, to such an extent that these associations are permanently written in our consciousness. For example yellow taxi reminds us New York City. This is of course a strong example. However, sometimes there are some things which become just a synonym for us. I’d like yellow Beeline shade to become a synonym of quality, functionality and a sense of uniqueness. I want to give the viewer a feeling that there is nothing wrong with it when he stands out from other people. The viewer has to learn from our film that he can set a new directions. Sometimes it's good to take a different course than the rest.
